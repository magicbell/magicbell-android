Updated topic and category filtering APIs in `StorePredicate`

Previously one was able to filter for multiple topics and categories, but this functionality is now deprecated in favor of only filtering for a single topic and category.
Please reach out to us via the [Community](http://www.magicbell.com/community) if you need the previous functionality.
